# Toy Store Backend Project

## Overview

This project serves as the culmination of our Java learning in school. The objective was to demonstrate the use of Java for backend development.

## Project Purpose

The requirement was to replace the C# backend of a full stack toy store project, originally created with React and C#, with Java. The task involved selecting one function from the C# project, rewriting it in Java, and ensuring the entire process from the database to the frontend works seamlessly.

## Requirements

- Replace the existing C# backend with Java.
- Connect to an SQL server database.
- Implement one complete function in Java.
- Ensure end-to-end functionality from the database to the React frontend.

## Results

I received a high mark for this project, demonstrating my proficiency in using Java for backend development and integrating it with a React frontend.
